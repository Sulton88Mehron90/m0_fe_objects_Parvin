# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? 
* the struggle I would say I had to go back and check the syntax often. Need to practice a lot to get the Objects Literal and Arrays syntax memorised.*
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
* I am doing much better work on updating and making notes.They are very helpful when I don't exactly remember the syntax. don't spend much time if the notes are handy. when I am doing my homework.*
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? * I try to solve a problem on my own first. I did have a tendansy to stay with problem longer. Now if I am stuck i reach out to my teammates.*
